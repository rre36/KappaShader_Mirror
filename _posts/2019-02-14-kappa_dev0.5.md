<h1>COMPLETE REWRITE</h1>

<h2>New Features and Additions</h2>

* overhauled shadow projection
  * improved edge behavior
  * very small shadow bias due to improvements
  * higher quality shadowing on translucency
* new shadow filtering
  * including soft and sharp shadows
  * much faster and better quality
  * three selectable quality presets
* PCSS shadowing
* overhauled volumetric clouds
  * new, more authentic cloud shape using worley noise
  * vastly improved performance
  * increased cloud quality by improving sample distribution
  * new and more accurate lighting modes
