### **This is the first version of Kappa Lite**

I decided to publish it as a public Release Candidate to bridge the time until I am done updating the regular Kappa version.
That may take some time since I also want to update some of my other projects before that (eg. Vanilla Plus).

#### Changes compared to Kappa 1.1

* complete atmospheric overhaul
  * atmosphere simulation for sky
  * vastly improved and optimized volumetric clouds
  * improved fog and water volume
  * redesigned general look and feel
  * improved water
  * vastly improved caustics
* vast optimizations to improve performance
* improved reflections
* many other internal improvements and bugfixes

#### Differences compared to the regular Kappa version

* volumetrics are done in quarter res for improved performance
* resourcepack pbr is not supported
* depth of field is not supported
* various effects are being done through different ways to improve performance
* only simple soft shadows are available
* no global illumination solutions
* probably some more I forgot about
