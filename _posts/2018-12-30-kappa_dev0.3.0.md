<h2>New Features and Additions</h2>

* REWROTE THE WHOLE THING, AGAIN...
* new shadow projection method
* new diffuse shading
  * Oren-Nayar with calculated pseudo-roughness for terrain
  * Burley diffuse on water and translucency
* improved cave darkness calculation
* atmospheric sunlight using the implementation from Lee
* added direct dithering to set screen color depth
  * should prevent dither pattern artifacts on certain displays
* volumetric clouds
  * sort of cumulus-like shape
  * with directional lighting
* volumetric fog
  * height based
  * volumetric lighting
* 2D clouds
  * high altitude cirrus layer
  * also lit by sun/moon
* biome dependent changes of sky, fog and clouds
* proper night skybox with stars
* custom filmic curve tonemap
* new daytime calculation
* AMD compatibility
* directional lighting dependent AO
* custom water normals and color
* rough temporal anti-aliasing
* smooth image based auto exposure
* lowlight desaturartion and grain to simulate the human eye
* proper ingame settings screen (will be expanded in the future)
* sunlight color no longer get's mixed into the skylight color

<h2>Currently not implemented / planned</h2>

* atmosphere simulation for a more realistic sky (not yet implemented after rewrite)
  * based on the implementation of the "magnificent" Lee
* Screen Space Reflections and Parallax Occlusion Mapping
* nether and end shaders

<h2>Improvements and Fixes</h2>

* semi-fixed particle lighting
* improved motionblur
* vastly improved wind effects
* improved translucency
* improved water shading
* improved soft shadowing
* improved dither pattern filter for fog and clouds
* improved AO algorithm
* better bloom threshold falloff
* changed emissive bloom behavior
* cleaned up internal code structure
* improved performance
