<h2>New features and additions</h2>

* new approximated atmospheric sky
* added option for atmosphere simulation for sky rendering (implementation based on Lee's approach)
* rewrote volumetric fog
  * overhauled volumetric fog coloring to match new sky
  * overhauled water volume
* added global illumination
* reworked shading pass
  * bilateral filtering on GI and AO for increased performance/quality ratio
* subsurface scattering on foliage and certain blocks
* new shadowmap warping (courtesy of chocapic13)
* added rain puddles
* added skylight diffuse
* overhauled reflection pass
  * new method for rough reflections
  * better sky reflections
* proper support for continuum 2.0 specular format
* added non-cirrus 2D clouds
* added parallax water waves
* added options to render layered and volumetric clouds in quarter/half resolution to save performance
* added setting to toggle "lighting only" viewmode
* added potion effects "blindness" and "night-vision" (WIP)

<h2>Improvements and fixes</h2>

* various performance optimizations
* improved clouds
* improved metal shading
* internal reorganizations
* fixed underwater fog at different sample counts
* extended sky luma slider
* more settings exposed to ingame screen
* adjusted shadow illumination for gi
* improved pseudo pbr
* improved bokeh depth-of-field
* pseudo pbr is now disabled by default
* metal shading without resource pack no longer requires pseudo pbr
* changed water coloring
* potentially fixed NaN-issues on nvidia
* fixed performance bottleneck in certain cases while on lower profiles

<h3>v0.7.1 changes</h3>

* improved water normals and caustics
* removed forced-legacy exposure on nVidia

<h3>v0.7.2 changes</h3>

* added wind effects on double plants
* fixed gbuffers_textured(_lit) on nVidia
* reworked worley noise texture
* tweaked cloud shape
* optimized cloud multiscattering lighting
* early out gi in lit areas
* improved lens flare bokeh
* fixed vanilla ao application
* fixed artifacts on fog caused by shadowtex lod
